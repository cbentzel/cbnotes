## RL

I hope to resume working on the Jack's parking lot examples. But didn't because I was mostly busy in other areas.

## Misc

Received two books over the holidays - Nexus by Yuval Harari, and unmasking AI by Joy Buolamwini. Both are critical of AI I believe - interested in what both say.

Read about half of Unmasking AI today. It's a pretty fast read. Some interesting pieces about data sets which I didn't know before - concern was face detection models didn't work well for darker skinned individuals, and part of it was because the data sets to train were gathered from public government figures - which skewed lighter skinned and male. Nothing too new to me, but good in general for reading.
