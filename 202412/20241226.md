Boxing Day!

## RL

My plan today is to go over an exercise or two in Chapter 4, and then read Chapter 5 and accompanying lecture (if available).

I also learned about another RL course by Dmitri Bertsekas:

There was also an interesting section at the end of Chapter 4 about how linear programming can be used for solving the MDP value/policy space, but is significantly slower than the DP approach. See slides at https://www.cs.cmu.edu/afs/cs/academic/class/15780-s16/www/slides/mdps.pdf which cover this. It's also amazing how much a single lecture covers - definition of MDP, Policy Iteration, Value Iteration, and Linear Programming approach to solving.

## Time

Time is always a tricky issue when dealing with robots - especially across a diverse set of computers without a single time clock.

Always have as a backup project to document how time works with computers and in general the history of humanity. It seems like a good general purpose book to write. A good title - "A Brief History of Time".
