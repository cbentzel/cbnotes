Boxing Day!

## RL

My plan today is to go over an exercise or two in Chapter 4, and then read Chapter 5 and accompanying lecture (if available).

I decided to focus on the "Jack's Auto Rental" problem, since it looked fairly interesting and was a bit heavier on the code side. I find having to implement one of the better ways to deal with theory.

Early code is here: https://github.com/cbentzel/rlrental

I wasted time though:
  * Used Cursor Compose to create a basic framework for a web app. I didn't love the overall approach it took.
  * I then wasted time looking into why create-react-app style scripts weren't working with newer typescript. Turns out that it's been unmaintained by Meta.
  * Spent a little time using Next, which I've used before on my website.
  * But then spent some time using Vite.

In any case, I didn't make actual progress on the RL problem. But that's OK, because I didn't have much time to work on it in general.

I also learned about another RL course by Dmitri Bertsekas:

There was also an interesting section at the end of Chapter 4 about how linear programming can be used for solving the MDP value/policy space, but is significantly slower than the DP approach. See slides at https://www.cs.cmu.edu/afs/cs/academic/class/15780-s16/www/slides/mdps.pdf which cover this. It's also amazing how much a single lecture covers - definition of MDP, Policy Iteration, Value Iteration, and Linear Programming approach to solving.

## Time

Time is always a tricky issue when dealing with robots - especially across a diverse set of computers without a single time clock.

Always have as a backup project to document how time works with computers and in general the history of humanity. It seems like a good general purpose book to write. A good title - "A Brief History of Time".
