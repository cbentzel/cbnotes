Decided to start writing daily notes publicly, similar to how I do work internally at companies.

## RL Basics

Watching David Silver's [3rd Lecture](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nd1-UUMVfz4) on RL focused on Dynamic Programming techniques for solving MDP solutions.

This includes a lot of examples from the Barto+Sutton book, such as gridworld or moving objects around.

The big notes of interest are:

* If you have a well-defined MDP, you can find an optimal policy and value function using a fairly straightforward path. This is kind of surprising, as I'd figure problem space wouldn't be convex enough to solve it.

* The solution feels a bit like how backprop works with training a network. You start with random weights/policies, and do a loop of forward pass/value evaluation with current policy, and then calculate an incremental step to improve things (gradient descent on loss function, or greedy choice of policy).

* Of course, in practice you don't actually have a full model of the decision space. So this is a nice basis but not practical in practice.


## Cursor 

I had started using Cursor instead of VS Code + Copilot on the fairly trivial Wordle clone. Some of the inline editing changes are pretty nice, but I haven't seen a drastic uptick in performance improvements. The one thing that is arguably better is Compose, but I haven't tried that yet. 

From a business perspective it seems like the best features that they do will just be copied by VS Code, so I have a hard time seeing that they have a sustainable advantage. Especially since the underlying LLMs are used by both (Claude Sonnet, 4o). 

Their business model also doesn't seem to allow for using something like Llama locally.

## Linear Programming

I read most of "An Illustrated Guide to Linear Programming" from Saul Bass which I had lying around the house. Very short book from 1970. 

Provides very intuitive basis for linear programming and more focused on problem setup and statements over the actual evaluation. This is actually a good approach because it is more focused on what problems are actually a good fit for linear programming than how to do the underlying solvers for it.

Only covers a 2D example of simplex method, which is fine. I haven't read the math appendix yet, which looks like it formalizes some of the other pieces in the book.

Most examples don't feel too dated, although there are fairly traditional gender roles representative of the time of authoring.
