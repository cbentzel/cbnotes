Not much time for technical work today - lots of home improvement/manual work.

## Misc

Small amount of time trying out Cyberpunk 2077, before quickly realizing it's not a game to play while my kids are awake.

Reading fun article(s) about the year in databases: https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~pavlo/blog/2025/01/2024-databases-retrospective.html

Last years was also good: https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~pavlo/blog/2024/01/2023-databases-retrospective.html

In particular, last year covered the rise of vector DBs in the wake of LLMs.

Despite the name, this is less focused on use of vectors as input (like other vector databases currently are with vector embeddings of data) and more about how the data is stored for fast retrieval of a few columns of data.
