Not much time for technical work today - lots of home improvement/manual work.

## Misc

Small amount of time trying out Cyberpunk 2077, before quickly realizing it's not a game to play while my kids are awake.

Reading fun article(s) about the year in databases: https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~pavlo/blog/2025/01/2024-databases-retrospective.html

Last years was also good: https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~pavlo/blog/2024/01/2023-databases-retrospective.html

In particular, last year covered the rise of vector DBs in the wake of LLMs.
