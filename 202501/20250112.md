## RL

Focus today was going back over TD learning.

* Chapter 6 of Barto Sutton
* Compact "Mutual Information" video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AJiG3ykOxmY
* Lecture [4](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PnHCvfgC_ZA) and [5](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0g4j2k_Ggc4) of David Silver's RL course.

Unlike Monte-Carlo, TD does not need to wait until end of an episode. Monte Carlo can actually be seen as an extreme version of TD learning as well.
