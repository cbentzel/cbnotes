## Test Organiations

Spent some time looking at how to create test organizations which are more SWE/infrastructure focused rather than manual tests or automation with existing frameworks.

## RL

Looked some more at TD(multistep) and trying to go a bit more over the theory Unfortunately, seems like some of the convergence properties tend to be seen experimentally rather than understand why that's going to happen.

Read the Atari paper from DeepMind. Definitely understand quite a bit more than reading the first time. However, I haven't read enough of Barto+Sutton to go through approximate policies.

https://gymnasium.farama.org/index.html is a general framework for doing RL experimentation. Planning to spend some time with it on something simple like a gridworld or a cardgame.
