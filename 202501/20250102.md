Way too much time playing videogames today - able to play Cyberpunk while the kids were out of the house.

Played through all of Act 1. Very impressive technically. Gameplay felt verry constrained though, with Kojima-length cutscenes. It was ultimately a long tutorial, and I heard that the game opens up after this.

Key note - the Brain Dance editor mode had some things I liked for visualizing historical details with robots.
